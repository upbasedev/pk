## Zn - CLI for Files - CDN Origin Server for Cloud Storage

[![crates.io](https://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/zn)](https://crates.io/crates/zn)

### Purpose

The purpose of this service is to be a CLI application for [files](https://crates.io/crates/files).

Zn is the elemental symbol for Zinc that is used to galvanize. This application wants to galvanize you to migrate from [aws s3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to [wasabi](https://wasabi.com/) to save serious money! 

Wasabi is 80% cheaper than AWS S3! By using Zn and [files](https://crates.io/crates/files) you can respect Wasabi's free egress policy by using a CDN provider like [CDN77](https://www.cdn77.com/).

Zn makes it easy to locally upload, locally download, and copy between cloud providers.

Zn in the future will support [lumber](https://crates.io/crates/lumber) to allow shipping logs from cloud storage and your local machine to [portal](https://crates.io/crates/portal) for search indexing.

Zn is currently in development and will be launched shortly.
